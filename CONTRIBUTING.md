# Contributing to kvokka/features

Thank you for considering contributing to the kvokka/features repository! We appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve this project. Below are the guidelines for contributing new features to the repository.

## Adding a New Feature

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository.

2. **Add Boilerplate**: Run `just add your-feature` to add boilerplate for your feature in `src` and `test`.

3. **Install Feature**: Modify `src/your-feature/install.sh` to install the feature. Some helpers are available for common install methods
    * [ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/gh-release](https://github.com/devcontainers-extra/features/blob/main/src/gh-release/README.md) for GitHub Releases
    * [ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/pipx-package](https://github.com/devcontainers-extra/features/blob/main/src/pipx-package/README.md) for Python packages via pipx

4. **Update Metadata**: In `src/your-feature/devcontainer-feature.json`
    * Replace `<installation-method>`  with the feature's install method, like `GitHub Releases`
    * Provide a short description of the feature
    * Provide a default version, or use the latest version
    * Add the image names of any helpers to `installsAfter`

5. **Add README**: Add a `src/your-feature/README.md` file with information about your new feature. It may help to copy a README from an existing feature. Include usage instructions, arguments, and any relevant details.

6. **Update Tests**: Replace `x.y.z` in `test/your-feature/scenarios.json` with the latest version of the feature. Then modify `test_specific_version.sh` to check for that version, and `test.sh` to check for any version.

7. **Test Your Changes**: Visit the Actions tab in your fork, and enable Actions. Then commit and push your changes, and ensure the tests pass.

8. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any additional information that may be helpful for the review process.

## Using `just` Commands

The repository contains a `justfile` with commands for testing and adding features. Here are some useful `just` commands:

* `just test <feature-name>`: Test a specific feature.
* `just test-scenario <feature-name> <scenario-filter>`: Test a specific feature with a scenario filter.
* `just unarchive <feature-name>`: Unarchive a feature from the `archive` directory.
* `just add <feature-name>`: Add a new feature using the templates in the `templates` directory.

## Additional Information

* **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the repository.
* **Documentation**: Ensure that your feature is well-documented, including usage instructions and any relevant details.
* **Testing**: Thoroughly test your feature to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce any issues.

## Using the `pipx-package` Helper

The `pipx-package` helper is a convenient way to install Python packages via pipx. It simplifies the installation process and ensures that the packages are installed in isolated environments.

To use the `pipx-package` helper, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Helper to Your Feature**: In your `devcontainer-feature.json` file, add the `pipx-package` helper to the `installsAfter` array. For example:

    ```json
    "installsAfter": [
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/pipx-package",
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python"
    ]
    ```

2. **Modify the Install Script**: In your `install.sh` script, use the `pipx-package` helper to install the desired Python package. For example:

    ```bash
    $nanolayer_location \
        install \
        devcontainer-feature \
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/pipx-package:1.1.9" \
        --option package='your-package' --option version="$VERSION"
    ```

3. **Test the Installation**: Ensure that the package is installed correctly by running the appropriate tests.
